AdapterBase
===========

A base class for a browser plugin loaded by webOS that renders content from a server running in another process. For example, the [isis-browser](/isis-project/isis-browser) app uses an [adapter](/isis-project/BrowserAdapter) to display web pages rendered by [BrowserServer](/isis-project/BrowserServer).

_No further development is planned on the component._

For current development news see [isis-project](http://isis-project.org).
